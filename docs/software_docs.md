## Code Change:

The code change involves removing a commented-out section from the `main.py` file in the `mvp` directory. The removed section contained a function definition for `mul(a,b)` and its usage in another function, but it was not used anywhere else in the code.

## Current Documentation:

### def fac(a)

Takes one input as an argument and calculates its factorial. The function uses a while loop to multiply the number by each decreasing integer until it reaches 0.

### def sub(a,b)

Takes two inputs as arguments and returns their difference.

## Updated Code Change:

## Updated Documentation:

### def fac(a)

Takes one input as an argument and calculates its factorial. The function uses a while loop to multiply the number by each decreasing integer until it reaches 0.

### def sub(a,b)

Takes two inputs as arguments and returns their difference.

### def add(a,b)

Takes two inputs as arguments and returns their sum.

Note: The documentation has been updated to reflect the removal of the `mul` function, which was not used anywhere else in the code.
