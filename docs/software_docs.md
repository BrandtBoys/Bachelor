## Updated Documentation:

### def fac(a)

Takes one input as an argument and calculates its factorial. The function uses a while loop to multiply the number by each decreasing integer until it reaches 0.

### def sub(a,b)

Takes two inputs as arguments and returns their difference.

### def add(a,b)

Takes two inputs as arguments and returns their sum.

Note: The documentation has been updated to reflect the addition of the `add` function, which was previously missing.
