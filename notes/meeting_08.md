# Meeting 8
- Når vi bruger 3rd party libraries, hvordan håndtere vi det i vores akademiske projekt
- Skal vi beskrive dem? Hvor meget? Skal vi være skeptiske, vurdere deres brug osv.
## Litteratur
- looking at why we have chosen to make an automated system, and what that actually means, we have looked at this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5387726
    - takeaways:
    - "automation is seen as a practical approach to increasing productivity and quality."
    - We want to use this to show how our approach differs from the more popular approach of integrating documentation assistance in IDEs, like co-pilot, and why this is not an automated workflow.
