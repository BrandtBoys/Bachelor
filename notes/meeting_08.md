# Meeting 8
- Når vi bruger 3rd party libraries, hvordan håndtere vi det i vores akademiske projekt
- Skal vi beskrive dem? Hvor meget? Skal vi være skeptiske, vurdere deres brug osv.
- Kan papers blive "for gamle" når det handler om ting som dokumentations principper?
- Og er preliminary/ conference papers gode nok?
## Litteratur
- looking at why we have chosen to make an automated system, and what that actually means, we have looked at this paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5387726
    - takeaways:
    - "automation is seen as a practical approach to increasing productivity and quality."
    - We want to use this to show how our approach differs from the more popular approach of integrating documentation assistance in IDEs, like co-pilot, and why this is not an automated workflow.

    - This is a preliminary articel, but it has some good points to reference in our intro:
    - source 8 from 1983: "Lacking and outdated documentation is one of the main causes of the high cost of software maintenance"
    - source 6 from 2007: After anayzing three opensource, they conclude that new code is not commented.
