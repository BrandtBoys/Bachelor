# Research question

- The human instead of a human.

# How much do the reader know about Github/Actions

- Not background on github workflow. Go higher level.
    - Do background on automation, ci/cd pipelines.
        - How much are these used in devops and “ml-ops”.
        - Use this to build the argument for why integrate our agent into the workflows.
    - Automation → CD → CD is used in devops, devsecops and so on. → Therefore it is natural to integrate into this.
    - If you want to tone it down. → Maybe in background speak about automation, ci/cd in general and how it is applied in github. → Start abstract, then example on implementation is github workflow.
- Dont write an entire wikipedia, be very specific.

# LLM vs SLM

- Maybe in design chapter, talk about this.
- Every single part of our report does not need to lead back into a segment in background.
- You can maybe speculate that a bigger model will be better → Paolo says it is boring.

- No need to go deep in LLM, motivate in introduction. → You thesis is not about llm, but about using llm.

# Include Design of our test setup as an experiment?

- This is method.
- Description of experiment setup is method.
- If you have to much. Then in method make hook, describe that you created this method, and then say “will be explained in section xxx”.
    - If not too lengthy, just put directly in method.

# Div.

- Use the paper on agents in methodology.
- A question on the exam could be “how would you explore if a large language model would be better”. → if you mention this in the discussion.
- If you decide to go deep in automation. → “What alternative entrypoints did you concider to keep the human in the loop”.
    - Questions is motivated about what you spend time on in your paper.
- Be very explicit. → “As described verbatum in x, …..”
- Also with images. → “Taken from x …”
