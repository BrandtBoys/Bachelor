# Agenda
 - Necessary to reference source when it is stated in Background?
 ### Show findings and thoughts on discussion. 
- **Q1**
An anecdote-style on what we have done.
- **Q2: Discussion of semantic score**: If it bad or not? it don't hold intent. And why it is "only" that good - the line between discussion and future work.
- **Q3: Discussion of reliability**: 73% - can we in the discussion hold that up against source showing the average coverage of function-level documentation, or should that have been a requirement to the system?
- **The overall discussion:** The level of trust, we as Software Devs opted for trust, and did maybe not challenge the research, by not thinking about the finished product, but look at how far we could go?

### What can we conclude?
- is i good or bad? or just state "We made it work, with X% success-rate, and mid/low knowledge of intend" or the more meta: the notion of trust, in how we found us constantly battling between trusting the system and its autonomous abilities.

### The technical description, how detailed?  
- like describing the algorithm on how we calculated the point to where a comment should be inserted - or since it is open-source people can just look at it, and we have described the bigger picture (use-case, components/dependencies, agent design and the used LLM)

### The Method section
- presenting the 3 subquestions
- describe how we have will answer them, and motivate why this method or metric will help us answer it.

### Experiment
- limitation and bias
