# Agenda
 - Necessary to reference source when it is stated in Background?
 ### Show findings and thoughts on discussion. 
- **Q1**
An anecdote-style on what we have done.
- **Q2: Discussion of semantic score**: If it bad or not? it don't hold intent. And why it is "only" that good - the line between discussion and future work.
- **Q3: Discussion of reliability**: 73% - can we in the discussion hold that up against source showing the average coverage of function-level documentation, or should that have been a requirement to the system?
- **The overall discussion:** The level of trust, we as Software Devs opted for trust, and did maybe not challenge the research, by not thinking about the finished product, but look at how far we could go?

### What can we conclude?
- is i good or bad? or just state "We made it work, with X% success-rate, and mid/low knowledge of intend" or the more meta: the notion of trust, in how we found us constantly battling between trusting the system and its autonomous abilities.

### The technical description, how detailed?  
- like describing the algorithm on how we calculated the point to where a comment should be inserted - or since it is open-source people can just look at it, and we have described the bigger picture (use-case, components/dependencies, agent design and the used LLM)

### The Method section
- presenting the 3 subquestions
- describe how we have will answer them, and motivate why this method or metric will help us answer it.

### Experiment
- limitation and bias
# Where to reference

Its allowed to put a new reference in discussion. As long as it is not an entire new topic.

Just cite the author and not background. Background makes sure the reader has read it before, and then just cite it.

# Discussion

Add introduction to discussion. 

## Q1

Two paragraphs instead of subsub sections.

Better titles.

## Q2

It could be interesting to see if semantic score was a usefull metric. Did we concider something  else. Did we find that it showed us anything, or maybe it didnt. 

Validity? Concstruct validity or internal validity. Limitation that comes with, write that.

And then in discussion, more nuanced what it gave us, if we think that works. 

## Q3

Biased knowing that. Discussion, or threats to validity → Be aware that we know, and then measured for it.

We wanted to test conceptually if this was possible. LLMs will advance, so the design is more important.

Overall discussion, check introduciton, how do you motivate your work. Then bring that motivation back into your discussion. Have some thought on what you learned, how far did you get. 

We tried to mitigate risk of this by, bla bla bl, and then we go into conclusion can conclude bla bla

Conclusion: We set out to investigate x
We set out to test by … method…
We validated it was valid approach. 

Maybe 2 numbers, and then done.
