# Where to reference

Its allowed to put a new reference in discussion. As long as it is not an entire new topic.

Just cite the author and not background. Background makes sure the reader has read it before, and then just cite it.

# Discussion

Add introduction to discussion. 

## Q1

Two paragraphs instead of subsub sections.

Better titles.

## Q2

It could be interesting to see if semantic score was a usefull metric. Did we concider something  else. Did we find that it showed us anything, or maybe it didnt. 

Validity? Concstruct validity or internal validity. Limitation that comes with, write that.

And then in discussion, more nuanced what it gave us, if we think that works. 

## Q3

Biased knowing that. Discussion, or threats to validity → Be aware that we know, and then measured for it.

We wanted to test conceptually if this was possible. LLMs will advance, so the design is more important.

Overall discussion, check introduciton, how do you motivate your work. Then bring that motivation back into your discussion. Have some thought on what you learned, how far did you get. 

We tried to mitigate risk of this by, bla bla bl, and then we go into conclusion can conclude bla bla

Conclusion: We set out to investigate x
We set out to test by … method…
We validated it was valid approach. 

Maybe 2 numbers, and then done.
