# Meeting 10

## Talk about our research question
Maybe add -> "Keeping the human in the loop", this would justify the design decission about having.

The "no change code" part should not be part of the research question. It should be the reliability of the agent, not of the documentation. 
This entire situation with text being vulnerable for code injection and similar would fit into the conciderations for part 2.
* Discussion.

Working developing environment -> Maybe delete this part. We know what it is, but its a bit vague, and probably already covered by the fact that we are looking into the whole integration into github.



### Sensible
Qualify more -> Choose a level of documentation. Be specific about e.g. function level documentation. (Remember you have to motivate why choosing this, when motivating our research questions)
Research questions should be more than yes no.

### Integration
Easy and effective. -> How do we meassure this. How do we understand these to parameters. 
Probably a better phrasing.
Maybe instead go:
* What are the challenges faced when integrating doctide into github workflows.
* What considerations should one take into account when tapping into ci/cd pipeline.

### Non intrusive
Non breaking and non intrusive is different things.
Level of human interaction needed.
* Maybe a bit too late to move away from pullrequest injection.

### Sensible / non-intrusive 
Probably overeagerness.
We could implement it if time.
Could also stop before, conclude that it does overdocumentation based on the literature. 
* future work, maybe give an idea of how that could be aproached.

##
Other way of writing the thesis (compared to the cycles aproach)
Paolo excpect a chapter for design.

The design chapter is the "answer" to the second point.
starts with dessign requirements

Then results/analysis will be the answers to the "sub questions".


Method intruces the research questions.
* "In order to investigate you break down into smaller parts."
Then you go down into the design conciderations
The challanges.
The quality of the comments provided
you motivate each of the sub parts.

Method is about described how we approach the problem of our research question.

Then you go into chapters "answering these sub things"
* "regarding design conciderations"

In the method, if you have 4 sub conciderations. these will be explored in the next for sections.
then result/ conclusion to the research question.

Discussion section:
look back at the research question and discuss that
future work?

Conclutssion:
