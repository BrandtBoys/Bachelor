# **Related work**

- when have we done our due diligence?
- AI-Based CI: It is not a direcly related work, but the field of CS looks at how LLM can improve the CI.

Usually related work is people do something, focus on this, then perspect to our. If you dont have the “relation to your project” then it does not go into related work.

If it goes into related work, you want to say what the world has done, and h**ow you fit in your contribution in this**.

If you dont have the part that draws perspective to your own work, then not related work. That parallel is always needed.

In the discussion you bring back related work, and your build on that in discussion. You bring the results in the light of the related work you brought in earlier.

Two words:

AI driven CI/CD → not needed.

We tend not to believe. → Different kind of words.

Instead of saying with confident. → ‘As evident from sec bla, various llms are capable to generate function level. Therefore we bla bla bla.

Dont keep it between the lines, be as specific as you can.

# **Background or Introduction**

- Automation, CI and DevOps

If you just have to points without comments, no bullets, just write it with text.

Automation → Paolo says → Reason to bring it down into background could be if intro is to bloated, but both are fine.

In introduction just motivate why automation. Then you can introduce it in background.

Use this as a introduction to devops, then you can just reference it.

# **Wording of subquestions**

- Is it okay that we split into subquestions, or should we call it areas of interest?

Investigate, not illuminate.

Follow the breaking down with the questions. 

Make it super clear that the next three questions will be answering the papers.

Methodology, you need to describe how you investigated these three. Then in the next section you describe what came out of it.

In method please describe how each of these will be investigated. 

Remember you should also have limitations/ threats to validity in each of the result sections.

If you move method into each of the following sections, then method should guide the user through this setup.

# **Referencing everything not an academic paper in footnotes**

- We have seen others do this. We would e.g. do it in the reference to crossencoders from sentence transformers

# **Conclusion**

- Since we have such a limited hardware, and to gain trust in its abilities to generate documentation, we have reduced its autonomic capabilities, maybe to a point where it no longer is an autonomous agent.

This could be some of the very good things to lean into in the discussion sections. We needed to look at feasibility, then we ended up constraining it.
