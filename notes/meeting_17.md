# Exam session QA

40 min pr. student (80min for us). Including everything.

Before the exam session they will discuss the paper, this is also included in the time. Usually 10 min for this. (+ 20 min for grading)

Then you will be called back in.

Max 20 min presentation, below it fine. But take the opportunity to use the time. 10-15 is good. Up to us how we split it between each other, does not matter.

After that it is group exam, individual grading.

- Either they just asks and talks and then one of us picks it up, and then at some point they will start making sure to ask directly at students.
- Alternative to this, after the presentation we say all out, and then we do timing and go in to be examined one after each other.  (15-20 min max)
    - Let Paolo know what we choose before exam.

After QA we will leave the room, and then they will do grading. 

Then as usual we decide if we want to have grades individually or together.

External censors love demos. SWU is cool because we develop. → Instead of just pointing at parts of the system, demo through a story.

## What should the presentation be about?

The presentation should cover your thesis.

- Here is the problem
- Here is what other people have done
- This is what we looked into
- This is the method we followed
- This is the discussion

You can follow the structure of the thesis.

## How much should we know about sources

- You need to know what you used.
    - Paolo would be asshole if they asked “but what else did they do”.
- It is more like “why did you put this source, and how did you use it.”
- But Wang we should know inside out!.

## Will there be questions on implementation

If you put a link, he might briefly go into the repo just to check it out. Maybe look at contributions, just to try and clarify that it is not just one developer who done all development.

## What questions are you going to ask

Probably in beginning clarify.

Then fairly broad.

And then dig deeper to see how far you go.

Later in exam the questions will be more to the point

And then at the end maybe reflection opening questions like “what might you have done differently”.

If Paolo asks questions out of the project its okay to say “its interesting, but not really a part of our scope, i can speculate, but it will be only speculations”. → Just dont say this if you actually have it in your project.

- Usually Paolo will step in if this is not part of the scope.

# Our questions

- **Should we display bugs and missing things that we have found after submitting the report?**
    - A bit of value in saying that we found some bugs, shows that we care about the product. But really dont spend 5 minutes about it, should be a minor add on. Nothing really important.
    - At the end of the day, they grade the document and our ability to answer questions. The presentation is something we can use to guide them a bit.
- **In the presentation, should we only focus on what we have achieved or is it also welcomed to talk about the future implications? The potential of an autonomous agent as the solution?**
    - Future work and perspektivering is absolutely welcome. Reflektion that says “we have realised that this this and this is wrong” is not good because then paolo will say “what have you been doing throughout this semester.
    - Instead they might ask stuff like “now that you are done, what might you have concidered doing differently” This is not the same as above!
- **How long time should presentation be? 10-15 min? Is that still the case when we are 2.**
    - Answered above.
