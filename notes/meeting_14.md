# Agenda
## due diligence
 - in our related work we have used X source, just to briefly justify our intuition and choice of approach.

## Wording of subquestions
 - Is it okay that we split into subquestions, or should we call it areas of interest?

## Referencing everything not an academic paper in footnotes
 - We have seen others do this. We would e.g. do it in the reference to crossencoders from sentence transformers
