## Related work

 - AI-Based CI: It is not a direcly related work, but the field of CS looks at how LLM can improve the CI.

## Background or Introduction
 - Automation, CI and DevOps

## Wording of subquestions
 - Is it okay that we split into subquestions, or should we call it areas of interest?

## Referencing everything not an academic paper in footnotes
 - We have seen others do this. We would e.g. do it in the reference to crossencoders from sentence transformers
