    """"""Sometimes it is necessary to set additional headers in a view.  Because
    views do not have to return response objects but can return a value that
    is converted into a response object by Flask itself, it becomes tricky to
    add headers to it.  This function can be called instead of using a return
    and you will get a response object which you can use to attach headers.

    If view looked like this and you want to add a new header::

        def index():
            return render_template('index.html', foo=42)

    You can now do something like this::

        def index():
            response = make_response(render_template('index.html', foo=42))
            response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'
            return response

    This function accepts the very same arguments you can return from a
    view function.  This for example creates a response with a 404 error
    code::

        response = make_response(render_template('not_found.html'), 404)

    The other use case of this function is to force the return value of a
    view function into a response which is helpful with view
    decorators::

        response = make_response(view_function())
        response.headers['X-Parachutes'] = 'parachutes are cool'

    Internally this function does the following things:

    -   if no arguments are passed, it creates a new response argument
    -   if one argument is passed, :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response`
        is invoked with it.
    -   if more than one argument is passed, the arguments are passed
        to the :meth:`flask.Flask.make_response` function as tuple.
