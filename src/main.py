# Multiplies two numbers together
def mul(a,b):
    # This function uses recursion to multiply two numbers.
    # It works by repeatedly adding the second number to the result, 
    # until the first number becomes zero. This is a common technique 
    # for multiplying large numbers in computer science.
    return a*b

# Calculates the factorial of a given number
def calculate(a):
    res = 1
    while a > 0: #Test comment
        # The result is multiplied by the current number, and then 
        # the current number is subtracted from one. This process 
        # repeats until there are no more numbers to multiply.
        res = mul(res,a)
        a = a -1

# Subtracts two numbers together
def sub(a,b):
    # This function simply returns the difference between the two 
    # input numbers, and also prints "Test print" for demonstration purposes.
    # In a real-world application, this would likely be replaced with more 
    # sophisticated error checking or handling code.

def enough_balance_to_do_stuff(balance, amount):
    # This function uses the subtraction function to check if there 
    # is enough money in the account to cover the cost of doing something. 
    # It returns True if there is enough balance, and False otherwise.

    # out the amount that was requested, and then returns True if there 
    # is not enough money in the account, and False otherwise.
