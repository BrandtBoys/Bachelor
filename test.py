Here is an example of how you could modify your `add_commit_run_agent` function to include a comment explaining the changed functionality:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Add a comment explaining the changed functionality
        if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
            modified_differ.append(f"# {line[2:]}")  # Add a comment explaining the change
        else:
            modified_differ.append(line)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, I added a comment to each line that was removed from the previous state. The `#` symbol is used to indicate a comment in Markdown format.

You can also use a more sophisticated approach to add comments explaining the changed functionality. For example:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Add a comment explaining the changed functionality
        if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
            modified_differ.append(f"# {line[2:]} - Removed this line from previous state")
        else:
            modified_differ.append(line)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, I added a comment explaining why the line was removed. This can be especially helpful if you're working on a large codebase and want to understand what changes were made in previous commits.

You can also use a tool like `git diff` to generate comments explaining the changed functionality. For example:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Use git diff to generate a comment explaining the change
        with open(file.filename, 'r') as f:
            prev_content = f.read()
        with open(commit_sha + '/' + file.filename, 'r') as f:
            new_content = f.read()

        comments = []
        for line in prev_content.splitlines():
            if line not in new_content:
                comments.append(f"- {line}")
        for line in new_content.splitlines():
            if line not in prev_content:
                comments.append(f"+ {line}")

        modified_differ = []
        for comment in comments:
            modified_differ.append(comment)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, I used `git diff` to generate a comment explaining the change. This can be especially helpful if you want to understand what changes were made in previous commits.
