Here is an example of how you could modify your `add_commit_run_agent` function to include a comment explaining the changed functionality:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Add a comment explaining the changed functionality
        if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
            modified_differ.append(f"# {line[2:]}")  # Add a comment explaining the change
        else:
            modified_differ.append(line)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, we're adding a comment to each line that was changed by removing the original comment. This will result in a file with inline comments explaining the changed functionality.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```python
# File: modified_file.txt

- Original code here
+ New code here
```

This way, when someone looks at the updated source code, they can easily see which lines were changed and why.
