Here is an example of how you could modify your `add_commit_run_agent` function to include a comment explaining the changed functionality:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Add a comment explaining the changed functionality
        if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
            modified_differ.append(f"# {line[2:]}")  # Add a comment explaining the change
        else:
            modified_differ.append(line)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, I added a comment to each line that was removed from the previous state. The `#` symbol is used to indicate a comment in Markdown format.

You can also use a more sophisticated approach to add comments explaining the changed functionality, such as:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

        # Add a comment explaining the changed functionality
        if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
            modified_differ.append(f"# {line[2:]} - Removed {line.split('#')[0].strip()}")
        else:
            modified_differ.append(line)

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

In this example, I added a comment explaining the reason for removing each line. This can be more helpful in understanding the changes made to the code.

You can also use a tool like `git diff` with the `-U` option to get a unified diff format that includes comments explaining the changed lines:

```bash
git diff -U0 HEAD~1 HEAD > updated_code.txt
```

This will generate a file called `updated_code.txt` that contains a unified diff format with comments explaining the changed lines. You can then use this output in your `add_commit_run_agent` function to add comments explaining the changed functionality.
