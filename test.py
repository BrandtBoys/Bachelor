Here is an example of how you could modify your `add_commit_run_agent` function to include a comment explaining the changed functionality:

```python
def add_commit_run_agent(commit_sha):
    branch = repo.get_branch(branch_name)
    ref = repo.get_git_ref(f'heads/{branch_name}')
  #Get the HEAD commit of test branch
    
    head_commit_sha = branch.commit.sha 
    head_commit = repo.get_git_commit(head_commit_sha)
  #code diff between the HEAD commit and the next commit
    
    diff = repo.compare(head_commit_sha,commit_sha) 

    modified_files = []

    for file in diff.files:
      #add the file to the set of modified files:
        
        file_language = detect_language.detect_language(file.filename) 
        if not file_language:
            continue
        
        modified_filepaths.add(file.filename)

        # Get the version of the modified file from the new commit
        content = repo.get_contents(file.filename,ref=commit_sha).decoded_content

        # Use helper script to remove all comments from the modified file
        cleaned_source = remove_comments.remove_comments(file_language,content).decode("utf-8")

        # Get the content of the file from the current HEAD (test branch)
        
        try:
          # Try to fetch the file from the current HEAD (test branch)
            
            head_content = repo.get_contents(file.filename,ref=head_commit_sha).decoded_content.decode("utf-8")
        except github.GithubException as e:
            if e.status == 404:
                print(f"File {file.filename} does not exist in {head_commit_sha} - treating as newly added file.")
                head_content = ""
            else:
                print(e.message)

        # Compare the cleaned source with head, to figure out which comments in HEAD the new commit 
        # would remove, since the new commit holds no comments.
        
        differ = difflib.ndiff(head_content.splitlines(keepends=True), cleaned_source.splitlines(keepends=True))
      #change the generator object to a list
        
        differ_list = list(differ)
      #the new file, with the latest code changes, but the comments from the previous state.
        
        modified_differ = []
        for line in differ_list:
            if re.match(r"-\s*#", line):
                modified_differ.append(line[2:])
            else:
                modified_differ.append(line)

        modified_file = difflib.restore(modified_differ, 2)
        modified_file_str = "".join(modified_file)
        
      #add modified files to list
        
        modified_files.append((file.filename, modified_file_str))

    commit_multiple_files(ref, modified_files, head_commit, "Add incoming files with updated functionality.")
```

This modification adds a comment explaining the changed functionality when creating a new commit. The comment is added using the `message` parameter of the `create_git_commit` function.

Here's an example of how this would look in the GitHub UI:

Commit message:
```
Add incoming files with updated functionality.
```

Changes:
```
- This line was removed
- This line was changed to do something else
```

Note that you may want to customize the commit message and changes to fit your specific use case.
