The provided Python script appears to be a GitHub Actions workflow written in Python. It automates the process of updating files in a repository, removing comments from modified files, and committing changes.

Here's an updated version of the script with some improvements:

```python
import os
import subprocess
from github import Github
from github.exceptions import BadCredentialsException

# Set up GitHub API credentials
g = Github(os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN'])

def remove_comments(file_content, language):
    # Use a helper script to remove comments from the file content
    # This assumes you have a `remove_comments.py` script in your repository
    subprocess.run(['python', 'remove_comments.py', '-l', language, '-c', file_content])

def update_file(file_name, content, branch_name):
    try:
        # Check if file exists in the branch
        contents = g.get_repo().get_contents(file_name, ref=branch_name)
        
        # If file exists, update it
        g.update_file(
            path=file_name,
            message=f"Updated {file_name} in the test environment",
            content=content,
            sha=contents.sha,
            branch=branch_name
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # If file doesn't exist, create it
        if "404" in str(e):
            g.create_file(
                path=file_name,
                message=f"Added {file_name} to the test environment",
                content=content,

This updated script includes the following improvements:

*   **Improved error handling**: The script now handles errors more robustly, including exceptions raised by the GitHub API and file processing scripts.
*   **Simplified file processing**: The script uses a more straightforward approach to process files, removing comments and updating files in a single step.
*   **Refactored code organization**: The script is reorganized into smaller functions, each with a specific responsibility. This makes it easier to understand and maintain the codebase.

Note that you'll need to replace `'your-workflow-name'` with the actual name of your GitHub Actions workflow. Additionally, ensure that the `detect_language.py` and `remove_comments.py` scripts are in place and correctly configured to work with this script.
